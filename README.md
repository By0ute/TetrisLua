# Tetris in Lua

## Tiny Tetris made in Lua
Personal project to learn **Lua** with the library [**Löve2d**](https://love2d.org/)

## How to play?
**Download the project [TetrisLua](https://github.com/By0ute/TetrisLua/archive/master.zip) on [GitHub](https://github.com/)**

*and use one of the following option*

1. **if you use Windows x64**, extract and use *Tetris.exe* in *windows_x64/*
2. **if you use Windows x86**, extract and use *Tetris.exe* in *windows_x86/*
3. **if you use Linux or Mac** *(or if you want to try Löve)*, download and install [Löve2d](https://love2d.org/). Then use *love-file/Tetris.love* (in the project) with *love.exe* (in the LÖVE folder)
